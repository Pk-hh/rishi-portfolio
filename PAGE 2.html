            <p>Hello! I’m <span class="highlight">P RISHI KUMAR</span>, an enthusiastic Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student currently pursuing my degree with a deep passion for technology and problem-solving. My academic journey has allowed me to explore the fascinating world of electronics, communication systems, and embedded systems, and I’ve developed a strong foundation in the principles of both hardware and software.</p>

            <p>From a young age, I’ve been captivated by how things work — whether it was disassembling gadgets or building simple circuits. This curiosity sparked my interest in ECE, where I could blend my love for electronics with my desire to innovate and create solutions that have a real-world impact. Throughout my studies, I’ve gained hands-on experience in various projects ranging from circuit design, microcontroller programming, and communication protocols to sensor-based systems and signal processing.</p>

            <p>I thrive on challenges, and I am particularly drawn to projects that allow me to push the boundaries of what technology can achieve. Some of my key interests include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Embedded Systems</span>: Developing software and hardware solutions for embedded platforms.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Signal Processing</span>: Exploring techniques to analyze, modify, and synthesize signals for communication applications.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Communication Systems</span>: Understanding and optimizing systems that allow devices to communicate seamlessly.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p>Apart from academics, I am also a strong advocate of teamwork and collaboration. Throughout my university projects, I have enjoyed working with my peers to bring ideas to life and tackle problems from different perspectives. I believe that learning is an ongoing process, and I strive to stay updated with the latest trends and advancements in technology by taking online courses, participating in workshops, and attending tech events.</p>

            <p>On this portfolio website, you will find a collection of projects I’ve worked on during my studies, as well as some personal projects that reflect my passion for ECE. I aim to demonstrate not only my technical skills but also my creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. My ultimate goal is to contribute to cutting-edge technologies that enhance lives and make a positive impact on society.</p>

            <p>I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations, so feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect, share ideas, or explore potential projects together!</p>
